      As a seasoned software engineer with over eight years of experience, I
      have a proven track record of delivering high-quality, scalable mobile and
      web applications used by millions of users worldwide. With a Bachelor's
      degree in Software Engineering in progress, estimated to be completed in
      2024, I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and staying at
      the forefront of technological advancements.


      I am highly proficient in JavaScript/Typescript and have extensive
      experience using popular libraries and frameworks such as React, NextJS,
      Redux, MaterialUI, styled-components, TailWind, Bootstrap, React Native
      and Expo, NodeJS, ExpressJS, NestJS, PrismaJS, and GraphQL. Additionally,
      I have a strong background in Python (Flask, Django, Selenium) and am
      well-versed in DevOps, with expertise in Docker, Heroku, AWS, Google
      Cloud, Microsoft CodePush, Vercel, Netlify, and the Serverless Framework.
      I have also worked with various databases, including MongoDB, PostgreSQL,
      and Firebase/Firestore.


      Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge in golang.

      In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and leader
      with a passion for collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring
      complex projects to successful completion.
