      ## About me.


      As a highly experienced software engineer with over 8 years of experience

      and a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering in progress, I am
      confident

      that I am the ideal candidate for the position at your company. Throughout

      my career, I have delivered high-quality, scalable web applications used
      by

      millions of users worldwide.


      ### Technical Skills


      My technical skills are extensive, including proficiency in

      JavaScript/Typescript, React, NextJS, Redux, MaterialUI,
      styled-components,

      TailWind, Bootstrap, React Native and Expo, NodeJS, ExpressJS, NestJS,

      PrismaJS, and GraphQL. Additionally, I have a strong background in Python

      (Flask, Django, Selenium) and DevOps, with expertise in Docker, Heroku,

      AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft CodePush, Vercel, Netlify, and the Serverless

      Framework. I also have experience working with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and

      Firebase/Firestore. Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge in

      golang.


      In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and leader

      with a passion for collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring
      complex

      projects to successful completion.
